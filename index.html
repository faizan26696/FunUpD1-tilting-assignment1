      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <small>G.O.A.T</small>
      <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo, (born Feb. 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Port.), Portuguese football (soccer) player. While
        playing with Manchester United (2003–09), he developed into one of the game’s best forwards, noted for his
        free-reined attacking style. In 2008 he helped United win a Champions League title, and that year he also was
        named FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2009 he joined Real Madrid. He won a second world player of the year
        award (renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or) after scoring 66 goals in 2013.

        In 2011, Cristiano Ronaldo was awarded the European Golden Boot after scoring 40 goals under Jose Mourinho,
        although Los Blancos could only finish second in La Liga and crashed out at the semi-finals of the Champions
        League.

        Rather than keep the award in his already packed trophy room - Ronaldo opted to sell it for charity.

        The boot went for auction and raised a stunning £1.2million.

        The funds went towards building a number of schools in war-torn Gaza.

        During the coronavirus pandemic few have stepped up to the plate like Cristiano Ronaldo.

        The Juventus forward, who earns £500,000-a-week wages at Juventus and has sponsorship deals with the likes of
        Nike, Armani, KFC, Herbalife, as well as his own range of CR7 clothes, shoes and underwear, has put his money
        where his mouth is and aided those in need.

        His years of success at Real Madrid and now at Juventus have made the Portuguese one of the most divisive
        athletes in the world.

        Adored by his fans for his ridiculous skill and achievement, Ronaldo also has an army of critics who hate his
        petulant behaviour and obsession with appearance and brand.

        But while many deride Ronaldo for his antics on the pitch, few know of his charity work off of it.

        Here’s why Ronaldo has one of the biggest hearts in all of sport.
